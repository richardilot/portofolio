            <small>Pure boredom.</small></li>
            <!--WHY-->
            <li><small>just</small>WHY?<br>
            <small>As a curious and want-to-learn-all younglings, I wanted to learn everything that will benefit my brain development.</small></li>
            <!--WHERE-->
            <li>WHERE did you start having these ideas?<br>
            <small>I believe as long as my brains are in the working state, ideas, small or big starts bouncing around and waiting for me to catch them all.</small></li> 
            <!--WHEN-->
            <li>WHEN did you start doing all these projects?<br>
            <small>18-09-2020: during COVID-19 2nd wave. remember that.</small></li>
            <!--HOW-->
            <li>HOW did you start doing all these things?<br>
            <small>As a youngling from Indonesia with zero experience and knowledge of how software and hardware made, <br>
                I wanted to get a concrete basic on my knowledge about computer science in general.<br>
                After I think I found the base, I wanted to start participating in real-world interaction. <br>
                My ideas were to just join hackathon for beginners, and doing random projects. Thus, I started from making my own website with pure HTML</small></li>
