                hey it's been a while (2020) - Albert Chang<br>
                <!--Paragraph 1-->
                <small><small>
                <p>Hey it's been a while. For those you who don't know why I've been one. Yup... I fucked up. Okay, that's an understatement. I REALLY fucked up. While I'm not famous by any stretch of the imagination, last year was the first time I was able to support myself as a content creator, largely thanks to my friends and peers who believed in me enough to promote me on their platforms.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 2-->
                <p>But I was weak. I let my physical and mental health fall to the wayside as my wrk became increasingly mixed with my personal life. Eventually, I failed to balance it all and ended up making some inexcusably terrible choices that cost me my career, my community , and many of the people closest to me. In short, I got cancelled.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 3-->
                <p>And I'm sure many of you want the details. The play-by-play. The internet is always hungry for drama, but if you're here for the tea, You're in the wrong place.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 4-->
                <p>What transpired was an intensely personal matter that has take substantial time for all parties to heal. And it's not my place to reopen old wounds to satisfy your curiosity. The intent of this video is quite selfish. It's a video for myself. A perpetual reminder of the hurt I've caused. But that mistakes aren't what ultimately define you. It's what you do after you make them.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 5-->
                <p>In the last year, I've been off social media, living alone. Not as a streamer. Not as a YouTuber. Just me. Albert. At first . all I felt was intense remorse and pain. It's easy to let people define who you are, especially when thousand of them are telling you, you are a sociopathic scum of the earth piece of shit who's very existence is a waste of space. And these feelings of self-loathing and humiliation seeped into all my social interactions.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 6-->
                <p>I was too ashamed to reach out to my friends and family, afraid they might reject of, or worse, receive flack for showing me compassion. So I socially distanced myself, long before it was necessary, and tried to escape reality through whatever means possible. I started sleeping 8 hours a day. I ate like there was no tomorrow. I binge watch TV shows and no-lifed video games, but no matter what I tried, I felt no happiness.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 7-->
                <p>It was then I understood, without my career and people I cared about in my life, I didn't know how to be happy alone. How did I become like this?</p>
                <!--Paragraph 8-->
                <p>When I was seven, my first generation Asian parents had an unbelievably original idea. Albert should try the violin. They baited me in by turning practising into a game. For every half hour I'd practice, they'd give me a sticker, and being the gamer that I was, you can bet I farmed those damn stickers. But to my horror, I began genuinely liking the violin. Even after my parents weaned me off the stickers, I continued to practice. Mom and Dad couldn't be happier. Asian parents LOVE flexing their kid's talents like Holographic Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and lucky for them, I needed no convincing to perform. I would bust out my violin and play for anyone who'd listen. And yah, I was bad. Really bad. But I didn't care. Seeing people smile and applaud made me happy. Made me want to play more.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 9-->
                <p>This same passion I had for the violin trickled into my other hobbies such as LEGO building, magic, and film-making. I just loved learning new things and sharing that love with other people. Sadly, these feelings changed when I turned my hobbies into my job. They say, if you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. Fuck that noise. When you do what you love, your life becomes your work. You can ever clock out. You're constantly thinking and working to deliver the best experience to your audience.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 10-->
                <p>For me I was always looking for ways to optimize my videos. My music. My social reach. My skills. My happiness was not a priority. So I hate to admit it, t at some point, my passions stopped bringing me joy. They were commodities I packaged and sold in return for self-validation and money. It became more about doing things I thought would be received well rather than what I wanted to do. And socializing was the only thing that could pull me from my work. Contrary to appearances, I'm actually an extrovert. I'm happiest when I'm spending time with the people I love, and doing things to make them happy.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 11-->
                <p>However, I was people pleasing to a fault. I could never say no. (phone call with his friends) “Hey Albert, can you help
                me film this video?”, “Hey Albert, can you make dinner tonight?”, “Hey Albert, can you cut your hand off for me?”. I
                valued the happiness and approval of my peers, friends, and loved ones far above my own, so I’d often squash my needs in
                order to meet the needs of others. If it made them like me more, well, that was enough for me.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 12-->
                <p>It took being cancelled for me to realize, I didn’t make myself happy. I always derived my happiness externally, whether
                it was for my career, or my close relationships, and not always in healthy ways. And having lost both, I had hit rock
                bottom. I took a good look at myself and asked, “Do you want to come back? You’ve hurt people. You’ve burned bridges.
                Did you even really enjoy content creation you ungrateful fuck. Maybe it’s time to try a different line of work.” And I
                thought about it. Why I got into it in the first place. Was it because of the fame? The promise of fortune? No, it was
                something else. I felt a spark rekindle inside me. I remembered the kid who loved the violin. The kid who was able to
                make others happy with his music even though he sucked, because it was clear he enjoyed what he was doing. I remembered
                that all I’ve ever wanted to do is learn and make cool shit that I like, with people that I like, and show that to the
                world. Because in many ways, I’m an artist. Not a great one. And maybe never will be. And I’m okay with that. So my
                answer? (Fuck yes).</p>
                <!--Paragraph 13-->
                <p>But I knew if I jumped back into content creation right away, then nothing is really changed. So as cliché as it sounds,
                I’ve begun working on myself. I started small, finding things to do solely for my own sake, and not anyone else’s. I
                learned to make my own coffee. No, not your basic ass Starbucks monstrosities or shitty instant Folgers, but homemade,
                pour over coffee. It may seem like work having to grind your own beans, weigh them, heat water to a specific
                temperature, and then pour at a steady rate over a designated period of time, but for me, this was empowering. I had
                lost control over my life, so making coffee was a step in regaining that control. I also started exercising
                consistently. Reddit armchair experts will tell you to hit the gym if you’re depressed, but I shit you not, it works.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 14-->
                <p>While I was still paranoid about being recognized in public, at the gym, no one gives a fuck who you are. Everyone’s
                just concerned about achieving one thing. Gains. And I needed that. A goal whether I reach it, is entirely up to me. And
                I found working out gave me confidence, which in turn made me feel happier. And with this newfound energy, I wanted
                something to direct it towards. I began looking into adopting a dog. So many cute dogs.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 15-->
                <p>But right before going to the shelter, my landlord shat on my dreams of becoming a dog owner. (call on phone) “No pets!
                And also, get rid of your shit in the living room.” Disappointed, but not discouraged, I went with the next best thing.
                Yeast. I raised my yeast starter from scratch. All it took was flour water, and 7 straight days of feeding and Yeast Boy
                was born. I take him on long walks, give him warm baths, watch TV shows together. He’s perfect, plus, I can eat him.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 16-->
                <p>You’d be hard pressed to find a bond that rivals that of man and yeast working together to create a delicious sourdough
                bread to fill the gaping void stemming from my lack of friendship and social interactions in my day to day life. But
                I’ve been working on that too. I started seeing a therapist, which has honestly helped me better understand myself. I’ve
                never shared so much and cried so much in front of someone I hardly know. I started making new friends who shared the
                same hobbies as me. Their passion for their crafts helped reinvigorate my own. I also reconnected with old friends. The
                ones who are there for you no matter what. The ones who I took for granted and I’m forever grateful for having met.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 17-->
                <p>And finally, I stopped ghosting my family all the time and started checking in more often. They’ve always given me their
                support when I’ve fucked up, and this time was no exception. And I know now, life’s too short not to appreciate and
                spend time with those who love you. You never know when you might be seeing them for the last time.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 18-->
                <p>Recently, my grandmother passed away. I loved my Nai Nai (grandma). She was one of my biggest fans, although she didn’t
                really understand what I did for a living. When time’s were tough, she would always ask me if I was taking care of
                myself, making me homecooked meals and sending me money whenever she could. It pained me to know that I worried her,
                because I knew just how much she loved me. So I never told her what happened. We knew she only had a few months left to
                live, and I didn’t want to burden her with that knowledge. She passed away peacefully believing that I was the
                successful and virtuous man I simply was not. But you can bet I’m working my ass off to prove her right one day.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 19-->
                <p>As of this year, I’m doing my best to lead an honest life, owning everything I’ve ever done. The good. And the bad. With
                fear and violence running rampant in the world right now, I’ve become more cognizant of my privileges. I started several
                creative projects I’m truly passionate about. And I’ve been learning to live for myself, so that I can be a more
                present, empathetic, and loving human being to those around me. And I know being cancelled doesn’t magically make you a
                better person.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 20-->
                <p>In fact, most people believe a cancelled person will never change. But change doesn’t just happen overnight. It’s a life
                long process. And I don’t know if the people I’ve hurt will ever accept my apologies.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 21-->
                <p>All I can do is work towards the day when I’ll be able to forgive myself. So, when you search my name in the future, may
                the person you find, be the person I resolved to become.</p>

                    <p>‘There’s no such thing as normal. It’s a stupid word. Does a lot of damage.’ (Tom to Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘Every little action of the common day, makes or unmakes character. It means that you’re built of everything you do.’
                    (Tom to Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘I think the whole special, being special thing is overrated. I think just to be a human being is hard. You know, really
                    hard.’ (Tom to Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘What’s wrong with not knowing, you know, being inconsistent? Just uncertain. Why do you have to be anything?’ (Tom to
                    Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘We are so lucky to be alive. We are so lucky to be able to help each other, in little ways, and in big ways. The reason
                    we are lucky is because helping each other is, in fact, what makes us happy.’ (Kate in charity concert)</p>
