                Last Christmas (2019) - Emma Thompson<br>

                    <p>‘There’s no such thing as normal. It’s a stupid word. Does a lot of damage.’ (Tom to Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘Every little action of the common day, makes or unmakes character. It means that you’re built of everything you do.’
                    (Tom to Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘I think the whole special, being special thing is overrated. I think just to be a human being is hard. You know, really
                    hard.’ (Tom to Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘What’s wrong with not knowing, you know, being inconsistent? Just uncertain. Why do you have to be anything?’ (Tom to
                    Kate)</p>
                    <p>‘We are so lucky to be alive. We are so lucky to be able to help each other, in little ways, and in big ways. The reason
                    we are lucky is because helping each other is, in fact, what makes us happy.’ (Kate in charity concert)</p>
